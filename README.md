# KibanaFocus
Browser userscript to help "focus-in" on fields within Kibana.
* Currently only supports the "traceidentifier" field.
* Focus links are displayed as anchor tags so they can be clicked to use the current window, dragged, copied, or middle clicked to focus-in within a new tab.
* Your current index, timeframe and displayed columns are carried across to your new focus window.
